# Laursen Status

Status page for your fivem server. It simply fetches your fivem servers status, like number of players online and calculates the average ping and displays your server restart schedule.

# Setting everything up:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open a cmd and navigate to the root of the folder you just downloaded.
3. Do ```npm install``` & ```npm run build```
4. You should now have a production build and should be able to start the website with: ```npm start```.

The website should now be running at port 3000, i recommend using cloudflared tunnel instead of opening port 3000.
